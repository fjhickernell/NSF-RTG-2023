To facilitate the construction and implementation of the reduced models, the problem is formulated as a reduced-order modeling problem. The reduced models can then be directly obtained from a Galerkin projection to appropriately deﬁned Krylov subspaces. The equivalence to a moment-matching procedure, previously implemented in [32], is proved. A particular emphasis is placed on the reduction of the stochastic noise, which is absent in many order-reduction problems. In particular, for order less than six we can show the reduced model obtained from the subspace projection automatically satisﬁes the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem. Details for the implementations, including a biorthogonalization procedure and the minimization of the number of matrix multiplications, will be discussed as well.},

  abstract = {The action potential of nerve and muscle is produced by voltage-sensitive channels that include a specialized device to sense voltage. The voltage sensor depends on the movement of charges in the changing electric ﬁeld as suggested by Hodgkin and Huxley. Gating currents of the voltage sensor are now known to depend on the movements of positively charged arginines through the hydrophobic plug of a voltage sensor domain. Transient movements of these permanently charged arginines, caused by the change of transmembrane potential V, further drag the S4 segment and induce opening/closing of the ion conduction pore by moving the S4-S5 linker. This moving permanent charge induces capacitive current ﬂow everywhere. Everything interacts with everything else in the voltage sensor and protein, and so it must also happen in its mathematical model. A Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP)-steric model of arginines and a mechanical model for the S4 segment are combined using energy variational methods in which all densities and movements of charge satisfy conservation laws, which are expressed as partial differential equations in space and time. The model computes gating current ﬂowing in the baths produced by arginines moving in the voltage sensor. The model also captures the capacitive pile up of ions in the vestibules that link the bulk solution to the hydrophobic plug. Our model reproduces the signature properties of gating current: 1) equality of ON and OFF charge Q in integrals of gating current, 2) saturating voltage dependence in the Q(charge)-voltage curve, and 3) many (but not all) details of the shape of gating current as a function of voltage. Our results agree qualitatively with experiments and can be improved by adding more details of the structure and its correlated movements. The proposed continuum model is a promising tool to explore the dynamics and mechanism of the voltage sensor.},

	abstract = {A thermodynamically consistent phase‐field model for viscous sintering is proposed. It is based on an energetic variational formulation that allows the governing equations to be analytically derived from a defined energy law. The conservation of mass is satisfied through the incompressibility assumption and the assumption that mass density is uniform initially within the particle compact while the balance of linear momentum is formulated from an energy dissipation law. The morphological changes of particles are described by the temporal and spatial evolution of a phase‐field variable governed by a modified Cahn‐Hilliard equation, and the motion of viscous mass flow is controlled by the Stokes equation incorporating the surface tension effect. The application of the phase‐field model is illustrated by examining the effect of particle shape, initial contact angle and rearrangement effects on viscous sintering.},

	abstract = {Experiments measuring currents through single protein channels show unstable currents, a phenomena called the gating of a single channel. Channels switch between an “open” state with a well-deﬁned single amplitude of current and “closed” states with nearly zero current. The existing mean-ﬁeld theory of ion channels focuses almost solely on the open state. The physical modeling of the dynamical features of ion channels is still in its infancy and does not describe the transitions between open and closed states nor the distribution of the duration times of open states. One hypothesis is that gating corresponds to noise-induced fast transitions between multiple steady (equilibrium) states of the underlying system. In this work, we aim to test this hypothesis. Particularly, our study focuses on the (high-order) steric Poisson−Nernst−Planck (PNP)−Cahn−Hilliard model since it has been successful in predicting permeability and selectivity of ionic channels in their open state and since it gives rise to multiple steady states. We show that this system gives rise to a gatinglike behavior, but that important features of this switching behavior are diﬀerent from the deﬁning features of gating in biological systems. Furthermore, we show that noise prohibits switching in the system of study. The above phenomena are expected to occur in other PNP-type models, strongly suggesting that one has to go beyond overdamped (gradient ﬂow) Nernst−Planck type dynamics to explain the spontaneous gating of single channels.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we focus on numerical solutions for random genetic drift problem, which is governed by a degenerated convection-dominated parabolic equation. Due to the ﬁxation phenomenon of genes, Dirac delta singularities will develop at boundary points as time evolves. Based on an energetic variational approach (EnVarA), a balance between the maximal dissipation principle (MDP) and least action principle (LAP), we obtain the trajectory equation. In turn, a numerical scheme is proposed using a convex splitting technique, with the unique solvability (on a convex set) and the energy decay property (in time) justiﬁed at a theoretical level. Numerical examples are presented for cases of pure drift and drift with semi-selection. The remarkable advantage of this method is its ability to catch the Dirac delta singularity close to machine precision over any equidistant grid.},

Secondly, we present a local uniform gradient estimate on the suitable weak solutions and assert that the local behavior of the solution can be dominated by some scaled quantities, such as the scaled local L3-norm of the velocity. Besides, when the initial data v0 and θ0 decay sufficiently rapidly at ∞, the distribution of the regular point set of the suitable weak solutions is also considered. Based on it, one can find that MHD equations are more similar to Navier–Stokes equations than Boussinesq equations.

  abstract = {Genetic drift describes random fluctuations in the number  of genes variants in a  population. One of the most popular models is the Wright--Fisher model. The diffusion limit of this model is a degenerate diffusion-convection equation. Due to the degeneration and convection, Dirac singularities will always develop at the boundaries as time evolves, i.e., the fixation phenomenon occurs. Theoretical analysis has proven that the weak solution of this equation, regarded as measure, conserves total probability and expectations. In the current work, we propose a scheme for 3-alleles model with absolute stability and generalize it to N-alleles case (\$N{\textgreater}3\$). Our method can conserve not only total probability and expectations, but also positivity. We also  prove that the discrete solution converges to a measure as the mesh size tends to zero, which is the exact measure solution of the original problem. The simulations illustrate that the probability density  decays to zero first on the inner nodes, then also on the edge nodes except at the three vertex  nodes, on which the density finally concentrates. The results correctly predict  the fixation probability and are consistent with theoretical ones and with direct Monte Carlo simulations.},

  abstract   = {The Cahn–Hilliard equation is a fundamental model that describes phase separation processes of binary mixtures. In recent years, several types of dynamic boundary conditions have been proposed in order to account for possible short-range interactions of the material with the solid wall. Our first aim in this paper is to propose a new class of dynamic boundary conditions for the Cahn–Hilliard equation in a rather general setting. The derivation is based on an energetic variational approach that combines the least action principle and Onsager’s principle of maximum energy dissipation. One feature of our model is that it naturally fulfills three important physical constraints: conservation of mass, dissipation of energy and force balance relations. Next, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the resulting system of partial differential equations. Under suitable assumptions, we prove the existence and uniqueness of global weak/strong solutions to the initial boundary value problem with or without surface diffusion. Furthermore, we establish the uniqueness of the asymptotic limit as 𝑡→+∞t→+∞\{t{\textbackslash}to+{\textbackslash}infty\} and characterize the stability of local energy minimizers for the system.},

There are two important characteristics: the finite speed propagation of the free boundary and the potential waiting time, which make the problem difficult to handle. Based on different dissipative energy laws, we develop two numerical schemes by an energetic variational approach. Firstly, based on flog⁡f as the total energy form of the dissipative law, we obtain the trajectory equation, and then construct a fully discrete scheme. It is proved that the scheme is uniquely solvable on an admissible convex set by taking the advantage of the singularity of the total energy. Next, based on 1/(2f) as the total energy form of the dissipation law, we construct a linear numerical scheme for the corresponding trajectory equation. Both schemes preserve the corresponding discrete dissipation law. Meanwhile, under some smoothness assumption, both schemes are second-order convergent in space and first-order convergent in time. Each scheme yields a good approximation for the solution and the free boundary. No oscillation is observed for the numerical solution around the free boundary. Furthermore, the waiting time problem could be naturally treated, which has been a well-known difficult issue for all the existing methods. Due to its linear nature, the second scheme is more efficient.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a mathematical model to study the transport of ions through ion channels. The system is derived in the framework of the energetic variational approach, taking into account the coupling between electrostatics, diffusion, and protein (ion channel) structure. The geometric constraints of the ion channel are introduced through a potential energy controlling the local maximum volume inside the ion channel. A diffusive interface (labeling) description is also employed to describe the geometric configuration of the channels. The surrounding bath and channel are smoothly connected with the antechamber region by this label function. A corresponding modified Poisson--Nernst--Planck channel system for ion channels is derived using the variational derivatives of the total energy functional. The functional consists of the entropic free energy for diffusion of the ions, the electrostatic potential energy, the repulsive potential energy for the excluded volume effect of the ion particles, and the potential energy for the geometric constraints of the ion channel. For the biological application of such a system, we consider channel recordings of voltage clamp to measure the current flowing through the ion channel. The results of one-dimensional numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate some signature effects of the channel, such as the current output produced by single-step and double-step voltage inputs.

	Abstract = {A macroscopic model to describe the dynamics of ion transport in ion channels is the Poisson--Nernst--Planck ({PNP}) equations. In this paper, we develop a finite-difference method for solving {PNP} equations, second-order accurate in both space and time. We use the physical parameters specifically suited toward the modeling of ion channels. We present a simple iterative scheme to solve the system of nonlinear equations resulting from discretizing the equations implicitly in time, which is demonstrated to converge in a few iterations. We place emphasis on ensuring numerical methods to have the same physical properties that the {PNP} equations themselves also possess, namely conservation of total ions, correct rates of energy dissipation, and positivity of the ion concentrations. We describe in detail an approach to derive a finite-difference method that preserves the total concentration of ions exactly in time. In addition, we find a set of sufficient conditions on the step sizes of the numerical method that assure positivity of the ion concentrations. Further, we illustrate that, using realistic values of the physical parameters, the conservation property is critical in obtaining correct numerical solutions over long time scales.},

  abstract      = {In this work, we treat the Poisson-Nernst-Planck ({PNP}) equations as the basis for a consistent framework of the electrokinetic effects. The static limit of the {PNP} equations is shown to be the charge-conserving Poisson-Boltzmann ({CCPB}) equation, with guaranteed charge neutrality within the computational domain. We propose a surface potential trap model that attributes an energy cost to the interfacial charge dissociation. In conjunction with the {CCPB}, the surface potential trap can cause a surface-specific adsorbed charge layer σ. By defining a chemical potential μ that arises from the charge neutrality constraint, a reformulated {CCPB} can be reduced to the form of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, whose prediction of the Debye screening layer profile is in excellent agreement with that of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation when the channel width is much larger than the Debye length. However, important differences emerge when the channel width is small, so the Debye screening layers from the opposite sides of the channel overlap with each other. In particular, the theory automatically yields a variation of σ that is generally known as the ``charge regulation'' behavior, attendant with predictions of force variation as a function of nanoscale separation between two charged surfaces that are in good agreement with the experiments, with no adjustable or additional parameters. We give a generalized definition of the ζ potential that reflects the strength of the electrokinetic effect; its variations with the concentration of surface-specific and surface-nonspecific salt ions are shown to be in good agreement with the experiments. To delineate the behavior of the electro-osmotic ({EO}) effect, the coupled {PNP} and Navier-Stokes equations are solved numerically under an applied electric field tangential to the fluid-solid interface. The {EO} effect is shown to exhibit an intrinsic time dependence that is noninertial in its origin. Under a step-function applied electric field, a pulse of fluid flow is followed by relaxation to a new ion distribution, owing to the diffusive counter current. We have numerically evaluated the Onsager coefficients associated with the {EO} effect, L21, and its reverse streaming potential effect, L12, and show that L12=L21 in accordance with the Onsager relation. We conclude by noting some of the challenges ahead.},

@book{greven_entropy_2003,
	Abstract = {The concept of entropy arose in the physical sciences during the nineteenth century, particularly in thermodynamics and statistical physics, as a measure of the equilibria and evolution of thermodynamic systems. Two main views developed: the macroscopic view formulated originally by Carnot, Clausius, Gibbs, Planck, and Caratheodory and the microscopic approach associated with Boltzmann and Maxwell. Since then both approaches have made possible deep insights into the nature and behavior of thermodynamic and other microscopically unpredictable processes. However, the mathematical tools used have later developed independently of their original physical background and have led to a plethora of methods and differing conventions. The aim of this book is to identify the unifying threads by providing surveys of the uses and concepts of entropy in diverse areas of mathematics and the physical sciences. Two major threads, emphasized throughout the book, are variational principles and Ljapunov functionals. The book starts by providing basic concepts and terminology, illustrated by examples from both the macroscopic and microscopic lines of thought. In-depth surveys covering the macroscopic, microscopic and probabilistic approaches follow. Part I gives a basic introduction from the views of thermodynamics and probability theory. Part {II} collects surveys that look at the macroscopic approach of continuum mechanics and physics. Part {III} deals with the microscopic approach exposing the role of entropy as a concept in probability theory, namely in the analysis of the large time behavior of stochastic processes and in the study of qualitative properties of models in statistical physics. Finally in Part {IV} applications in dynamical systems, ergodic and information theory are presented. The chapters were written to provide as cohesive an account as possible, making the book accessible to a wide range of graduate students and researchers. Any scientist dealing with systems that exhibit entropy will find the book an invaluable aid to their understanding.},

	Abstract = {An energy-based, phase field model is developed for the coupling of two incompressible, immiscible complex fluid phases, in particular a nematic liquid crystal phase in a viscous fluid phase. The model consists of a system of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations for conservation of mass and momentum, phase transport, and interfacial boundary conditions. An efficient and easy-to-implement numerical scheme is developed and implemented to extend two benchmark fluid mechanical problems to incorporate a liquid crystal phase: filament breakup under the influence of capillary force and the gravity-driven, dripping faucet. We explore how the distortional elasticity and nematic anchoring at the liquid crystal-air interface modify the capillary instability in both problems. For sufficiently weak distortional elasticity, the effects are perturbative of viscous fluid experiments and simulations. However, above a Frank elasticity threshold, the model predicts a transition to the beads-on-a-string phenomenon associated with polymeric fluid filaments.},

	Abstract = {The {Poisson--Boltzmann} ({PB)} equation is conventionally used to model the equilibrium of bulk ionic species in different media and solvents. In this paper we study a new {Poisson--Boltzmann} type ({PB\_n)} equation with a small dielectric parameter 2 and non-local nonlinearity which takes into consideration the preservation of the total amount of each individual ion. This equation can be derived from the original {Poisson--Nernst--Planck} system. Under Robin-type boundary conditions with various coefficient scales, we demonstrate the asymptotic behaviours of one-dimensional solutions of {PB\_n} equations as the parameter approaches zero. In particular, we show that in case of electroneutrality, i.e. α = β, solutions of {1D} {PB\_n} equations have a similar asymptotic behaviour as those of {1D} {PB} equations. However, as α ≠ β (non-electroneutrality), solutions of {1D} {PB\_n} equations may have blow-up behaviour which cannot be found in {1D} {PB} equations. Such a difference between {1D} {PB} and {PB\_n} equations can also be verified by numerical simulations.},

	Abstract = {We use the idea in [33] to develop the energy law preserving method and compute the diffusive interface (phase-field) models of {Allen--Cahn} and {Cahn--Hilliard} type, respectively, governing the motion of two-phase incompressible flows. We discretize these two models using a C0 finite element in space and a modified midpoint scheme in time. To increase the stability in the pressure variable we treat the divergence free condition by a penalty formulation, under which the discrete energy law can still be derived for these diffusive interface models. Through an example we demonstrate that the energy law preserving method is beneficial for computing these multi-phase flow models. We also demonstrate that when applying the energy law preserving method to the model of {Cahn--Hilliard} type, un-physical interfacial oscillations may occur. We examine the source of such oscillations and a remedy is presented to eliminate the oscillations. A few two-phase incompressible flow examples are computed to show the good performance of our method.},

	Abstract = {This paper develops a first-order system least-squares ({FOSLS)} formulation for equations of two-phase flow. The main goal is to show that this discretization, along with numerical techniques such as nested iteration, algebraic multigrid, and adaptive local refinement, can be used to solve these types of complex fluid flow problems. In addition, from an energetic variational approach, it can be shown that an important quantity to preserve in a given simulation is the energy law. We discuss the energy law and inherent structure for two-phase flow using the {Allen--Cahn} interface model and indicate how it is related to other complex fluid models, such as magnetohydrodynamics. Finally, we show that, using the {FOSLS} framework, one can still satisfy the appropriate energy law globally while using well-known numerical techniques.},

@article{HoLiLiEi12,
	Abstract = {The flow of current through an ionic channel is studied using the energetic variational approach of Liu applied to the primitive (implicit solvent) model of ionic solutions. This approach allows the derivation of self-consistent ({Euler?Lagrange)} equations to describe the flow of spheres through channels. The partial differential equations derived involve the global interactions of the spheres and are replaced here with a local approximation that we call steric {PNP} ({Poisson?Nernst?Planck)} (Lin, T. C.; Eisenberg, B. To be submitted for publication, 2012). Kong combining rules are used and a range of values of steric interaction parameters are studied. These parameters change the energetics of steric interaction but have no effect on diffusion coefficients in models and simulations. Calculations are made for the calcium ({EEEE}, {EEEA)} and sodium channels ({DEKA)} previously studied in Monte Carlo simulations with comparable results. The biological function is quite sensitive to the steric interaction parameters, and we speculate that a wide range of the function of channels and transporters, even enzymes, might depend on such terms. We point out that classical theories of channels, transporters, and enzymes depend on ideal representations of ionic solutions in which nothing interacts with nothing, even in the enormous concentrations found near and in these proteins or near electrodes in electrochemical cells for that matter. We suggest that a theory designed to handle interactions might be more appropriate. We show that one such theory is feasible and computable: steric {PNP} allows a direct comparison with experiments measuring flows as well as equilibrium properties. Steric {PNP} combines atomic and macroscales in a computable formulation that allows the calculation of the macroscopic effects of changes in atomic scale structures (size ? 10?10 meters) studied very extensively in channology and molecular biology.},
