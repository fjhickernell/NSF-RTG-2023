  abstract = 	 {Interacting agent and particle systems are extensively used to model complex phenomena in science and engineering. We consider the problem of learning interaction kernels in these dynamical systems constrained to evolve on Riemannian manifolds from given trajectory data. The models we consider are based on interaction kernels depending on pairwise Riemannian distances between agents, with agents interacting locally along the direction of the shortest geodesic connecting them. We show that our estimators converge at a rate that is independent of the dimension of the state space, and derive bounds on the trajectory estimation error, on the manifold, between the observed and estimated dynamics. We demonstrate the performance of our estimator on two classical first order interacting systems: Opinion Dynamics and a Predator-Swarm system, with each system constrained on two prototypical manifolds, the $2$-dimensional sphere and the Poincar√© disk model of hyperbolic space.}

abstract = {Dynamical systems across many disciplines are modeled as interacting particles or agents, with interaction rules that depend on a very small number of variables (e.g. pairwise distances, pairwise differences of phases, etc...), functions of the state of pairs of agents. Yet, these interaction rules can generate self-organized dynamics, with complex emergent behaviors (clustering, flocking, swarming, etc.). We propose a learning technique that, given observations of states and velocities along trajectories of the agents, yields both the variables upon which the interaction kernel depends and the interaction kernel itself, in a nonparametric fashion. This yields an effective dimension reduction which avoids the curse of dimensionality from the high-dimensional observation data (states and velocities of all the agents). We demonstrate the learning capability of our method to a variety of first-order interacting systems.}
