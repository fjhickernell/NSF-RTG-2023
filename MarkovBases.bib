@article{MixingTimeSwitchChain-overview,
	abstract = {Since 1997 a considerable effort has been spent to study the mixing time of switch Markov chains on the realizations of graphic degree sequences of simple graphs. Several results were proved on rapidly mixing Markov chains on unconstrained, bipartite, and directed sequences, using different mechanisms. The aim of this paper is to unify these approaches. We will illustrate the strength of the unified method by showing that on any P-stable family of unconstrained/bipartite/directed degree sequences the switch Markov chain is rapidly mixing. This is a common generalization of every known result that shows the rapid mixing nature of the switch Markov chain on a region of degree sequences. Among the applications of this general result is an almost uniform sampler for power-law and heavy-tailed degree sequences. Another application shows that the switch Markov chain on the degree sequence of an Erd{\H o}s-R{\'e}nyi random graph G(n,p) is asymptotically almost surely rapidly mixing if p is bounded away from 0 and 1 by at least 5lognnâˆ’1.},

@article{BesagClifford89,
	abstract = {Simple Monte Carlo significance testing has many applications, particularly in the preliminary analysis of spatial data. The method requires the value of the test statistic to be ranked among a random sample of values generated according to the null hypothesis. However, there are situations in which a sample of values can only be conveniently generated using a Markov chain, initiated by the observed data, so that independence is violated. This paper describes two methods that overcome the problem of dependence and allow exact tests to be carried out. The methods are applied to the Rasch model, to the finite lattice Ising model and to the testing of association between spatial processes. Power is discussed in a simple case.},

@article{Yuguo-Chen-2007,
	abstract = {We develop a set of sequential importance sampling (SIS) strategies for sampling nearly uniformly from two-way zero-one or contingency tables with fixed marginal sums and a given set of structural zeros. The SIS procedure samples tables column by column or cell by cell by using appropriate proposal distributions, and enables us to approximate closely the null distributions of a number of test statistics involved in such tables. When structural zeros are on the diagonal or follow certain patterns, more efficient SIS algorithms are developed which guarantee that every generated table is valid. Examples show that our methods can be applied to make conditional inference on zero-one and contingency tables, and are more efficient than other existing Monte Carlo algorithms.},
